# Concerns {.smaller}

- Low sampling frequency
    - Aliasing of high frequency components

- Lack of gyroscope
    - Sensor fusion for orientation estimation cannot be used

## Low sampling rate {.smaller}

Sampling a high frequency component (red) at a low sampling rate will cause the high frequency component to look like a low frequency component (blue).

This could get mixed up with real low-frequency components.

Additionally, when we then low-pass the data, it might become distorted.

## Low sampling rate {.smaller}

This might not be such a large problem in gait data. 

There is a lot of power concentrated to below 15 Hz. 

See articles: 

<https://alkvi.github.io/imu_comparison/#frequency-components-of-gait>

## Orientation estimation {.smaller}

The MobGap implementation uses the [Madgwick filter](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975346) to estimate global frame orientation, to better estimate stride length and walking speed.

This requires a gyroscope (and preferably a magnetometer).

The ActiGraph does not have this.

However, to at least counteract variations in ActiGraph placement, the vertical axis could be aligned with gravity before each gait sequence, if we detect a stable period before the gait sequence. 

For example using something like [Moe-Nilssen 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0268-0033(98)00089-8).

## Comparison {.smaller}

The same MobGap pipeline was run on both lumbar Opal and hip ActiGraph data.

- Gait sequence identification
- Intial contact detection
- Cadence estimation
- Stride length estimation
- Walking speed estimation

## Comparison - filtered data {.smaller}

Here is the same snippet of gait data from the Opal and ActiGraph bandpassed between 0.15 Hz and 3.14 Hz, as used in [initial contact detection](https://github.com/mobilise-d/mobgap/blob/main/src/mobgap/initial_contacts/_icd_ionescu.py).

There does not seem to be issues with high frequency components, at least during stable gait such as this example.

## Comparison - gait sequence and initial contacts {.smaller}

This a comparison of detected gait sequences and initial contacts for an approximately 8 minute walk outside including variations in pace, turning, some stopping. There is a difference of 4 found initial contacts (772 vs 768).

## Comparison - stride length in lab {.smaller}

This comparison of stride length without orientation estimation (left) vs with orientation estimation (right) illustrates a slight systematic error for the ActiGraph, but subject parameters can clearly be delineated.
