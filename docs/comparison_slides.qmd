# Concerns {.smaller}

- Low sampling frequency
    - Aliasing of high frequency components

- Lack of gyroscope
    - Sensor fusion for orientation estimation cannot be used

## Low sampling rate {.smaller}

Sampling a high frequency component (red) at a low sampling rate will cause the high frequency component to look like a low frequency component (blue).

This could get mixed up with real low-frequency components.

Additionally, when we then low-pass the data, it might become distorted.

## Low sampling rate {.smaller}

This might not be such a large problem in gait data. 

There is a lot of power concentrated to below 15 Hz. 

See articles:

## Orientation estimation {.smaller}

The MobGap implementation uses the [Madgwick filter](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975346) to estimate global frame orientation, to better estimate stride length and walking speed.

This requires a gyroscope (and preferably a magnetometer).

The ActiGraph does not have this.

However, to at least counteract variations in ActiGraph placement, the vertical axis could be aligned with gravity before each gait sequence, if we detect a stable period before the gait sequence. 

For example using something like [Moe-Nilssen 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0268-0033(98)00089-8).
